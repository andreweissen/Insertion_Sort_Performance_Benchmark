### CMSC 451 Insertion Sort Performance Benchmark ###

#### Overview ####

This project, created for CMSC 451 Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, serves as a performance benchmark of the traditional insertion sort algorithm, employing both iterative and recursive variations thereof and acquiring performance data for each. Each variation is tested using a total of 10 data sets of various sizes, with each set employed for a total of 50 individual tests. The resultant data and associated calculations, such as the average time, average critical operation count, coefficient of variance, and standard deviation, are displayed in a Swing GUI for ease of examination and comparison between variations.
